The Bank Loan Report Dashboards provide a comprehensive view of the bankâ€™s lending performance and portfolio health. These interactive Power BI dashboards enable users to monitor key metrics such as total loan applications, funded amounts, repayments received, average interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios.
The reports are organized into three main sections:
1.Summary Dashboard for high-level KPIs and loan quality distribution.
2.Overview Dashboard for analyzing trends by time, geography, and borrower segments.
3.Details Dashboard for record-level insights into individual loans.
Together, these dashboards help stakeholders track loan performance, assess risk, and make informed, data-driven decisions.
